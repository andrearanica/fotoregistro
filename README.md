# 🧑‍🏫 Fotoregistro
This app allows students and teachers to make a digital photo register for the classes in an easy and quick way.

### 📚 How and why?
The teacher that wants to make a photo register has to make an account as a professor and give the access code to his students. The students can make their accounts and upload their photo, and then when they enter into a new class the photo will be shown to the teacher without using mails or messages.
