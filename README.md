# 👨🏻‍🏫 Fotoregistro
With this application you can keep under control all your student's faces... so you can't forgot them!
\Next version soon
### 🔎 Why should I use this?
With this application you just have to give a link to your classes and then your students can insert their photos on their own (so you don't have to take the pictures and waste you smartphone memory).

### 📗 How can the teacher see the classes?
If a teacher wants to see his students' faces, he has to login and then he can choose one of his classes and create a PDF register.
